## 2016 UNF Git Walkthrough

Preparing your environment
------

### Step 1 - Git Some
* Git is something running on your computer. Not a website.
* You will interact with it in order to save and share work.
* Go download it here for your respective operating system:
* ##### https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Installer defaults are fine.

### Step 2 - Git Bash
* If you are unfamiliar with a terminal, DO NOT SKIP THIS.
* You need to know 2 basic commands while operating in the terminal:
1. cd
2. ls
* 'cd' is short for 'change directory'.
* 'ls' is short for 'list'.
* Both can be explicit or context based.
* You will use these to move around your folder structure and see its contents.
* Type the following in the terminal, pressing enter after each line.

```
mkdir /c/Projects
cd /c/Projects
ls -la
```

* You just made an empty folder called Projects at the root level of your C:\ drive.
* You then changed the directory Git Bash is looking at, to said Projects folder.
* Finally, you listed out all the folder contents, including itself, and the parent folder ('.' and '..' respectively)
* (Optional), go here for more practice:
